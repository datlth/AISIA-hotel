273510,Nice looking room , spacious with a bath . Our mistake not to check but about 1 . 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started . This is a really noisy place , the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning ( 5 . 30am ) people using power tools . There are rodents in the roof . The bathroom looks great but the water doesn ' t flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over . The bath is really nice , but the hot water only fills about 1 / 5 of it at a time . Not that we would have used it , as it was too cold , but the pool was empty . Staff at reception were unwelcoming , didn ' t provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don ' t speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also , so made it hard to communicate at all . An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren ' t asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine , but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc . let alone wanted something else . We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves . When we realised this wasn ' t going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out . We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left . No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were ' unlaunderable ' and had to pay 180 , 000 dong to replace them ! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins . So , this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don ' t recommend it at all .

The view from the room was amazing - rice field upon rice field . The beds were extremely comfortable and we were provided with mosquito nets . The food was incredible , some of the best we ’ ve eaten in Vietnam ( so fresh ). The trek itself was great too got to see a lot of ethnic minority villages and on the second day walk through a bamboo forest and to a waterfall . We felt the trek was perhaps slightly of a more advanced level than we originally thought . We ( three 21 year old students ) found it quite challenging at times and there was not a lot of smooth paths to walk on . We feel this is important to mention as older people or people with perhaps sustained i juried may find this difficult !

273148,The facilities of the apartment are great . Brand new building . The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn ’ t work . The swimming pool was stunning . The organisation and communication was poor !! I requested a double bed but I had twin room . I ’ m the person who can ’ t sleep on a tiny bed . I realised that I made booking with an individual owner , not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner , not the hotel staff . The staff from the owner came without notice , ring the bell and ask to pay the bill . She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment . regardless I couldn ’ t sleep . This room includes breakfast but be aware that it ’ s not hotel breakfast !!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast .

This time it was cancelled again during the night . They clearly didn ’ t want me to write a bad review and do this whenever there are complaints . I had to request a review form off booking . com support to write this . I would not trust the review score at all .

When asking the receptionist , he said it ’ s 3 star and they ’ re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future . This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too . When arriving , the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view . But that ’ s not what we booked . So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty . Fatty fingerprints everywhere , dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months . We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn ’ t sleep the whole night .

I visited Vietnam 3 years ago and did not have a pleasant experience with one of the hotel . Since then I was wary of coming back here . I am glad to say that Sun river staff changed my attitude towards Vietnam and I am so glad I came back and I now have happy memories of this country .

They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop . I rented motorbike from here . They have really new and good quality bikes . The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house . They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat , cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike . The extra luggage can also be stored for free . They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop . The staff at the reception speaks and understands English . While the facilities are top notch , their maintenance is not upto the mark . People wear shoes in the dorms , there is nobody responsible for the lockers . There are lockers but the key is not available . I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people . They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests .

271187,Location : 300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches . Personnel : the owner / receptionist is particularly annoying . 1 . there is no price list . So she could charge anything , disregarding the Booking ' s price . if you don ' t agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking - smelling room , not as in the picture advertised . You are not allowed to remove the tray . 2 . there is no cup / glass , or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room . She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw , and telling me that " no need to touch / change them ". 3 . When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor , she was very argumentative , trying to put the blame on me . Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues . She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently . She would never stop talking , once she was in my room . 4 . The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID , she did not have any question . After she got to know me in he afternoon , she asked me if I have money to lend her , I laughed and left . When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick . She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble . I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone . When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately ( eventhough it was almost midnight ). She then shut up , and let me go to rest . The next day , the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked , and tried fixing the leaking basin . So I stayed and She left me alone since . 5 . Everyday , room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin , she made me to throw them outside the building site . Lastly , I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account . upon realising , I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon . ####[['300 - 800m near buses , co - op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'service', 'negative'], ["there is no price list . so she could charge anything , disregarding the booking ' s price", 'service', 'negative'], ["if you don ' t agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking - smelling room", 'service', 'negative'], ['not as in the picture advertised', 'branding', 'negative'], ['you are not allowed to remove the tray', 'service', 'negative'], ['there is no cup / glass , or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room', 'facility', 'negative'], [' she had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw , and telling me that " no need to touch / change them', 'service', 'negative'], ['when i complained about the tv not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor , she was very argumentative , trying to put the blame on me', 'service', 'negative'], [' she was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything i said or requested persistently . she would never stop talking , once she was in my room', 'service', 'negative'], ['after she got to know me in he afternoon , she asked me if i have money to lend her', 'service', 'negative'], [' she did not care but kept dragging on questioning my id , trying to cause me trouble', 'service', 'negative'], ['everyday , room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin , she made me to throw them outside the building site', 'service', 'negative']]

271338,Ideally located ( 10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below ), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds , excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good . Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable . The resort , despite it ' s beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it ' s actually a greedy money grab . One particular incident left a very sour note for us . The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat . The resort charged us over 200k per person for this " tour " for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart . Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up . So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride .

273490,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead , so I can only comment on that . Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom . We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool . Breakfast was very good and a sensible price . if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel . Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner . A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage . The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing . We landed on a ( relatively ) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport . The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance . We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that . There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead , giving the address . A sketch map would have been useful ! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel . The gentleman on reception took us up to a room , leading in and coming back out very rapidly . Obviously there was some kind of problem , and he wished to be professional about it . He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card . We were ushered to another room , which was clearly an upgrade . Whilst it lacked a couple of things ( such as a toilet roll , which appeared the next day ), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom .

He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags . We could not see him anywhere . Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags . Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late .

270187,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake , the cute little streets , restaurants , night market , you name it . When you enter the hotel , you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches , and the most welcoming staff . Will , the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived , explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour - guide , and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits . Will is not the only gem in this hotel , as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness , which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect . The hotel has a lift , a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby , the rooms have great beds ( thank you ) and a good lay - out for the space in an inner city hotel . It also has a lovely breakfast place ( beautiful decoration ) with good choices of food and drinks , and again great staff . However , one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far . So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her / his talents .

We were made delicious breakfast and dinners on both days . The little girl was a delight to be around . We loved spending time in this home away from home .

275391,Amazing hotel right in the center of HCM city , perfect for a stay to visit and explore the city . Compact , yet the building is a beautifully designed oasis in the middle of the chaos of the city . The rooms and common areas are beautiful , the lobby lounge is a lovely cozy area to chill with a cup of coffee or tea . I saw some comments about the breakfast being limited - it is a small selection but is delicious and had some wonderful local classics and coffee , so did not mind it at all . There is also a lovely pool at the roof and small gym , did not use but looks great . Highly recommended and will definitely go back . Wonderful to go back to the calm , cool oasis after a crazy day out in the city1 Nothing ! If anything , it was a noisy area , mostly from music from bars and some events in the area , but that isn ' t really the hotel ' s fault .

273791,Pool area was really nice , rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable . I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer . Staff very friendly . After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception , I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception . There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification , he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked ! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that : The card can only be unblocked in the U . K . For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card ! He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful , or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U . K . no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else , especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number . I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge . At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake , he did also give me a complimentary cola . Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full . Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card !

270885,- Nice bedroom .- Clean interior .- Free 2 bottles of water and 2 packs of tea . Hotel located at about 3 km away from city centre , far from tourist attractions .

Unfortunately I was given 12th floor with very limited view . The double bed for 2 persons is just a single 1 . 2m bed .
