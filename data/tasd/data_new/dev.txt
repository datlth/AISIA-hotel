271204,The location is central , there is a supermarket nearby , nice Banh - Mi - Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby ( E - Coffee ). There were toilet amenities ( soap , TP , toothbrush ). The AC was working and quiet . We booked this hotel . We arrived after a long journey , and a sign was saying : we send you a message with all booking infos to self check - in . Said message never arrived . I contacted the responsible , who was quick to answer : we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location . That ' s how we got to Supertramp . Funny thing : it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full . This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it ' s a scam . Now , reading other reviews , I realized it happened before . Coming to Supertramp : It ' s a construction site ! At first we got offered a room with no window , which was not what we booked . They showed us another room , which we took . The room contained a kitchen and a washing - maschine ( both not working ) and a bed . The room was so tiny that we couldn ' t put our bags on the ground . Why do you put a not functioning kitchen + machine if there is no space already ?! The cupboards were moist , some dirty towels were roting in them . The room was dirty . I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt , dust and spiderwebs . The walls are quite thin and not soundproof , so we heard everything ( from neighbors to elevator and construction work ). We wanted to pay online , but they didn ' t accept it : only cash . As we just arrived , we didn ' t have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill . We stayed 3 days . Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money ( even though we previously made an agreement ). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a . m ( she wouldn ' t stop knocking , spoke no English , just said " money , money ". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up .

276287,Nice breakfast . The pool area was ok but not as good as the photo on the website . To be fair this is not my kind of hotel . This is my 8th trip to Vietnam . This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in in Vietnam and the one I liked the least by a long way . My friend wanted to stay on that street and likes luxury and thought she was getting it based on photos . The hotel was very tired . My room on the 2nd floor was large and had 2 windows that I could not lock ( the sliding window was too big for the space ). The room was dark 24 / 7 as the windows looked onto a ventilation well . The bed was comfy enough and the shower hot - although it was inside the bath which I always find dangerous - there were slippery surface signs everywhere so assume there had been some disasters . There were renos at the hotel which we only found out about when we checked in - the room directly above mine was being ripped apart so there were drills , jackhammers etc from 7 . 30am to 5pm everyday of our 3 night stay . My friend paid extra for a room with a view on the 8th floor - she looked straight onto a big pillar and the street below - at least she had natural light . We got our rooms at a comparatively very very cheap price during the black friday sales but both agreed we ' d paid way too much . The location is nice if you are newby to HCMC and scared of crossing the street but no way is this the real Vietnam - it is cheesy tourist central . Way way better and cheaper hotels in other parts of District 1 . As a note the regular guy on the egg station appeared to me to be up himself - there was a trainee guy working with him from one of the universities who was absolutely delightful and friendly who was trying very hard but was very nervous - the supervisor was a rude a ..... to him - as a mum I really wanted to give him a hug and say it will get better - keep going young man you have a great personality that will take you far .

276229,- The breakfast was very good , there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit ( in a generous portion ). Sometimes they even surprised us with additional spring rolls or banana pancakes which were delicious .- The location is midway between the beach and the old town , which can be both reached very easily by bike in 10 - 15 minutes ( the owner lend us the bikes for free !). It is also just beside the rice fields , so you can take a small walk and admire the beautiful landscape . There are also minimarket / restaurants / pharmacies nearby that you can reach by walking in case of need .- The best of all was of course the owner which made us feel just like home with her energy and her generosity . She also helped us to book the tours we wanted to take around Hoi An . When we come back to Hoi An ( which we will do for sure !), we will definitely be staying here again .

270499,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre . It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel . The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area . The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more . The homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions . The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness . Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them ! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view . Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us . It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days . It is a great value for price ! The only inconvenience ( that can be easily rectified ) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC .

The hotel is also very convenient and accessible to food stores , grocery and attractions .

We like the big window facing the city view . We also like the put “ don ’ t disturb ” or “ clean ” sign that you can show outside your door . The receptionist was accommodating and nice . The safety box was not working . So we had to always secure our valuables ourselves . There was unpleasant smell in the room . It seems like smoke from outside gets inside our room even if window is closed and especially the AC is turned on you can still smell it .

273071,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel . The location is great . It ’ s in the centre of the old quarter but it ’ s peaceful and quiet inside . The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place . All the staff are so friendly , especially Ms Karathy and Jay . Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport , our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived . Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out . The day of our check out , the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening , when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue . My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station . We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it , fortunately , they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station . We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday . I hope the manager knows what fantastic staff they have , especially Ms Karathy and Jay . ####[['the location is great', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['it ’ s in the centre of the old quarter but it ’ s peaceful and quiet inside', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place', 'experience', 'positive'], ['my family and i had a very comfortable stay at hanoi silk centre hotel', 'branding', 'positive'], ['all the staff are so friendly , especially ms karathy and jay . ms karathy booked our transfer from the airport , our trip to ha long bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived', 'service', 'positive'], ['jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out', 'service', 'positive'], [' the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening , when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to hue', 'experience', 'positive'], ['they did find the medication and jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station', 'service', 'positive'], ['he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday', 'service', 'positive']]

276951,- Very new hotel , our stay was at the very end of August 2022 and we were told the hotel has only been open for 10 days . - Trendy decorations and good ambiance . - Perfect location to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi . - Good breakfast , we enjoyed the Pho , fresh juices and fruits especially . Restaurant staff extremely friendly . - Adding to the fact that it is new , everything is nice and clean . Every time we were coming back to the hotel after sightseeing in the city , it just felt like a breath of fresh air , since the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic , the heat , the trash and vermin , our room in the spotlessly clean hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax . - Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude . Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome . Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street , and they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong . The front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3 - day Halong Bay Cruise , helped us to communicate with our Grab driver over the phone . - There were still constructions going on in the hotel ( like the sky bar and spa were not yet ready during our stay ). - Walls of the room are not really sound proof , you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds , but this goes for most of the hotels in the Old Quarter according to our research . - The air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep , ( my husband ' s side was not affected as much ), we could not switch it off because it was quite hot in Hanoi when we were there , but the room is quite small ( as always , it is a norm in most hotels in the Old Quarter ), so there is literally no where else they can put the vent . ####[['trendy decorations and good ambiance', 'facility', 'positive'], ['perfect location to explore the old quarter of hanoi', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['good breakfast , we enjoyed the pho , fresh juices and fruits especially', 'service', 'positive'], ['restaurant staff extremely friendly', 'service', 'positive'], ['adding to the fact that it is new , everything is nice and clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it just felt like a breath of fresh air', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the streets of hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic , the heat , the trash and vermin', 'experience', 'negative'], ['our room in the spotlessly clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax', 'experience', 'positive'], ['staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude', 'service', 'positive'], ['everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome', 'service', 'positive'], ['bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street', 'service', 'positive'], ['they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong', 'service', 'positive'], ['the front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3 - day halong bay cruise , helped us to communicate with our grab driver over the phone', 'service', 'positive'], ['walls of the room are not really sound proof , you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the room is quite small ( as always , it is a norm in most hotels in the old quarter )', 'facility', 'negative'], ['this goes for most of the hotels in the old quarter according to our research', 'amenity', 'positive']]

270314,The apartment is modest in size but sufficiently facilitated . There are enough amenities for either business or vacation short stay . My favorite things are probably the modern wooden interiors and the staff being quite helpful . Although there is a swimming pool in Vinhomes park , I wouldn ' t recommend it if you ' re looking for some relaxing swimming time . Apart from the additional fee , entrance requires a resident ' s approval which was quite a hassle , we had to contact Merry House ' s staff and waited outside the pool for 15 minutes until they got someone to let us in .

A very good Indian restaurant is in same alley as the Guest House too . It ’ s very safe as the main gate is always closed and only can be opened with key card . There is a small window in the room but facing another wall ( but better than no window ) No sound isolation and lot of guests returned to guest house around midnight to 1am so it was impossible to sleep until like 1 - 2am . Besides that it was calm , even though it ’ s just around the corner to Bu Vien Walking street .
